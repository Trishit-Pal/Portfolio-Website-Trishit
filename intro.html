            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Trishit Pal and , I am from Kolkata. I completed my graduation in Power Engineering from Jadavpur University in 2023.
                I did my schooling from Bhavans G.K. Vidyamnadir, affiliated to C.B.S.E. and passed my class 12th examination in the year 2018.
            </p>
            <p>During the starting years in my college, I found interest in programming and problem solving, which in turn made me learn some fundamental programming languages like C and C++.
                Exploring the language and programming domain introduced me to the field of data analytics and Machine Learning.
                The field of analytics and software development fascinates me, and I am constantly driven to expand my skills and knowledge in these areas.
            </p>
            <p>Beyond the world of academics and programming, I am huge football lover having played this game during my childhood and school days. I was a part of school's football team as well, but spent most of my games in the reserve bench unfortunately. 
                I was also a member of school's yoga team and participated and even won a few awards in various competitions on both intra and inter school level.
                Last but not the least, I tried my hands in painting as well having completed my 4th year in Fine Arts in 2013. 
            </p>
            <p>As I embark on this professional journey, I firmly believe in the power of meaningful connections and collaborations. I am always open to new opportunities that allow me to leverage my skills and contribute to impactful projects. If there are any avenues where our paths may intersect or if you have any insights or guidance to offer, I would be grateful to connect with you.</p>
